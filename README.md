## How it works?

> First you'll need to generate the team list running the command bellow in your terminal:

```
python get_team_names_JSON.py

```

This file will get all the data from table table found in "https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/stats/team/_/season/2023" and writting into a JSON file

> Then you can run the next file:

```
python marchmadness.py

```

The program will print the full bracket result, separeted by regions and then the final four and finally the championship
